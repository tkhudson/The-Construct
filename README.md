# The Construct

**AI-Powered Realms Where Your Imagination Builds the Adventure**

## Game Summary

The Construct is a cross-platform digital tabletop RPG that brings D&D 5e (and other genres) to life with AI as your Dungeon Master. Play solo or with friends, create characters, explore worlds, and resolve actions through a chat-driven interface—no physical dice or books required. The AI handles rules, rolls, and narrative, adapting to your choices and pacing the story to fit your session length.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered DM (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, or built-in fallback)
- Theme-based adventures (Classic D&D, Modern Zombies, Star Wars, Post-Apocalyptic, Custom)
- Streamlined character creation (theme-aware races/classes/traits)
- Chat-driven gameplay with dice roller and skill checks
- Visual grid map for combat/exploration (token placement and movement)
- Session timer and pacing (AI escalates story as time runs out)
- Session logging and continuation (resume where you left off)
- Modern, pastel dark mode UI
